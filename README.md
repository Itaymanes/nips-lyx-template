# Lyx template for NIPS 2016

Some modifications of the template from https://nips.cc/Conferences/2016/PaperInformation/StyleFiles to work in Lyx. Note that NIPS 2016's template is substancially different from earlier years. A different package is used for the line numbering for draft versions.

To switch to draft mode for submission, remove the [final] from the style declariaton in document->settings->LaTeX preamble.
